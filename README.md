# The Petfinder API for WordPress Toolkit
A collection of PHP, CSS and JavaScript to help you display a list of animals available for adoption on your WordPress site using the Petfinder API.

This toolkit is intended for web developers, and is intended to be customized for your site design. If you don't have any coding experience, try the fantastic [Petfinder Listings plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/petfinder-listings/).

*__Note:__ This toolkit is not a WordPress plugin. It's a collection of files that you will need to manually add to your theme.*
